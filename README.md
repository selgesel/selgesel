## About Me
Hi, I'm an avid gamer and an experienced software developer. I've been sitting in front of a computer since 1993, and I've dreamt of making games ever since.

I'm currently doing gamedev as a hobby, but I intend to do it full-time and ditch my professional career as a software engineer.

For me, sharing is an important part of the learning process, so I try my best to turn what I've learned into bite sized pieces and share them with others.

I put example code bits and projects on GitHub, I post videos on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQYs-YajJnu0dmPNe2lXlow), and I blabber about stuff on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/selgesel). I also have a [Tumblr blog](https://selgesel.tumblr.com/) but I rarely use it, if ever.

If you wish to contact me, feel free to DM me on Twitter.
